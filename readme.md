# Lab 1 - HTTP based simple FTP client server functionality

## CLI Client

- Assuming CLI client will use hardcoded IP `127.0.0.1:5000`
- If file with same name exists, it will be overwritten

## Server

- Main thread will pause for user input, so `CTRL+C` is not necessary to exit
- All paths are assumed to be relative

## Browser

- Tested with Edge, Firefox and Chrome on Windows and Mac platforms
- Depending on browser configuration, the selected file mapy be displayed instead of being downloaded
